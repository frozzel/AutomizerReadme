  ## Description
  Here at CupOTears we know how important it is to have your favorite cup of joe in front of you to pour you tears into as you face those coding challenges. With that in mind, we created this site for you to search all the amazing coffee beverages out there to see how the different drinks are made as well as their nutritional value.

  -When you arrive to the site you will see a search bar to search popular coffee beverages from around the world. Explore some of your favorite beverages or check out some new ones. The autocomplete feature displays a drop down list of available drinks to search. If you have found yourself on our site, you must love coffee as much as we do. So take a look and find yourself the perfect drink to pour your tears into. Once you choose a beverage to search, the results will diplay on the right side of the page with ,a detailed description of the drink, it's ingredients, nutrition facts, and a beautiful image of the beverage. The search results are pulled from calling two different server-side APIs. SampleApis gave us the description, image, and ingredients of each coffee drink and Nutritionix provided the results for the nutrition facts. We've also included a Coffee Notes section where you can record which drinks you are interested in trying or just anything you want to jot down. The notes will be displayed in your computer's local storage so when you return to the page your notes will still be there.
  -We never knew there were so many different types of coffee drinks out there and we wanted to share this with you.
  -We hope you will enjoy exploring all the different coffee drinks! Get ready for your next cup and pour your tears!
