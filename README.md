  ## Description
  You can quickly and easily generate a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project.

  -I was motivated to utilize my nodeJS skills to shorten my project times by creating a simple README Generator.

  -This project helped me to furter understand nodeJS and ES6

  -Some problems I ran into where in the list function of the promt inquirer npm, once reading through the online materials I was able to fix the problem and move forward!
  
  -This app will streamline the development process by redicing the time to create a readme template
